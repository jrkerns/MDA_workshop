    "# Best Practices: Control Flow\n",

    "Control flow statements (``if``, ``for``, ``while``, etc blocks) make decisions based on conditions and execute either certain lines of code or execute a given number of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow can become convoluted quickly if guidelines are not kept in mind. Control blocks themselves add a bit of complexity to your code. Instead of simply reading line-by-line, the reader/programmer must try to follow several cases or decide when the loop has accomplished its purpose. This is increasing complexity, not reducing it."
