    "# Best Practices: Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are the first level of abstraction in programming. It's not practical to squish every statement onto one line. Variables are a way to abstractly hold information we want to do things with later on. It's the foundation of any script, function, and class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correct use of variables can make or break the readability of your code. It's very easy to use bad practice with variables when first starting out programming. "

    "### General Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use a variable for only one purpose.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Good example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = len(5, 6, 8])\n",
    "  y = x * 5\n",
    "  z = round(y)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Bad example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  x = len([5, 6, 8])\n",
    "  y = x * 5\n",
    "  x = round(y)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Keep \"live time\" and \"spans\" as short as possible**\n",
    "  * Live time -> the total number of lines the variable lives for (e.g. lines 10-50 = 40-line live time)\n",
    "  * Spans -> the number of lines between the use of a variable\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Initialize new variables near where they will be set.** \n",
    "  I.e. don't initialize a set of variables at the beginning of a long function/method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numlines = 0\n",
    "  linedata = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "  # long set of calculations w/ no use of numlines or linedata\n",
    "  data1 = ...\n",
    "  lines_found = ...\n",
    "\n",
    "  numlines += lines_found\n",
    "  linedata[key] = data1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Use variables even for simple results of operations, especially for use in control flows**. Naming of results \n",
    "  especially helpful when doing comparison operations. \n",
    "  The following isn't overly complicated, but isn't perfectly clear:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  if num_students > 30 and teacher.is_stressed():\n",
    "      students.move(5, new_classroom)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  The following separates out the complexity so it's clear what is being considered.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  classroom_overloaded = num_students > 30 and teacher.is_stressed()\n",
    "  if classroom_overloaded:\n",
    "      students.move(5, new_classroom)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Now, if the conditions for being overloaded change, they can be added to the ``classroom_overloaded`` statement \n",
    "  and leave the control flow operation as-is.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  roi_is_right_size = ... # boolean expression of several factors\n",
    "  roi_is_in_view = ... # boolean expression of other factors\n",
    "  roi_is_dense = ... # boolean expression to calculate whether density is enough\n",
    "  \n",
    "  if roi_is_right_size and roi_is_in_view and roi_is_dense:\n",
    "      ... # proceed\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Don't mix variable types** MATLAB especially doesn't handle this well so be careful not to mix, e.g. strings     and numbers. "

    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important principle when naming a variable is that **the name must fully and accurately describe the data and/or meaning at all times.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use opposites for variable pairs.** E.g.:\n",
    "  * begin/end\n",
    "  * first/last\n",
    "  * old/new\n",
    "  * source/destination\n",
    "  ```python   \n",
    "  first_ROI = ...\n",
    "  last_ROI = ...\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "* **Use names that imply True or False for boolean variables**. E.g.:\n",
    "  * done\n",
    "  * found\n",
    "  * success\n",
    "  * processed\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    if num_targets > 3:\n",
    "        targets_found = True\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        targets_found = False\n",
    "        success = False\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  You may also attach ``is`` to imply True/False. E.g. ``is_empty``.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Don't use \"magic\" numbers; use named constants instead.** Magic numbers are numbers used in a program that seem to come out of thin air. Named constants are values that don't change during the course of the program and should replace all \"magic numbers\". Named constants have two benefits. \n",
    "  They give a name to a number; you might forget the meaning of the number later on. As well, if the number \n",
    "  is used multiple times you can change the number once and all uses are updated.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Named constants:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  NUM_CPUS = 4\n",
    "  MAX_TABLE_SIZE = 200\n",
    "  INTEREST_RATE = 4.675\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Usage in a function:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  cpu_pool = PoolExecutor(NUM_CPUS)\n",
    "  balance = 12000\n",
    "  accrued_interest = calc_intrst(balance, INTEREST_RATE)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This will be needed more in MATLAB than Python because Python allows the input of \"keyword arguments\". These allow one to use literal numbers without being \"magic\":\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  accrued_interest = calc_intrst(balance=12000, interest_rate=4.675)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Put qualifiers at the end.** We deal with quantities quite often, and qualifiers like \"max\", \"average\", \"sum\", \n",
    "  etc should be used at the end. *This should be how you can differentiate between a function and data variable, particularly with MATLAB's ambiguous syntax*. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  numbers = [13, 44, 9, 30]\n",
    "  numbers_max = max(numbers)\n",
    "  numbers_avg = average(numbers)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Especially for MATLAB where parentheses are used for both indexing and function calls this is important. \n",
    "  Is ``max_numbers(5)`` an index call to the 5th element of a data array or a function call asking for the 5\n",
    "  largest numbers?\n",
    "  \n",
    "      \n",
    "* ***i, j* and *k* are acceptable as loop indices for short loops, although full names are preferable. If the loop is long, always use full names.**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For Python, full names are easy since you're looping over the actual item:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  for line in lines:\n",
    "      line.plot()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  For MATLAB and enumerated Python iterations, where you're forced to use an index, use i, j, k for short loops and   more descriptive names\n",
    "  for longer loops\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  for i = 1:10\n",
    "      line[i].plot()\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "* Use standard abbreviations you might find in a dictionary\n",
    "* Remove all non-leading vowels (``screen`` becomes ``scrn``)\n",
    "* Remove articles (`a`, `and`, `the`, etc)\n",
    "* Keep the first and last letter of each word (works best for short words. E.g. ``leftkidney`` becomes ``ltkidney``)\n",
    "* Keep the names pronouceable (use `xPos` rather than `xPstn`)\n"
