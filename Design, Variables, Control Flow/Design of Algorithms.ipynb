    "In speaking of \"design\", we usually mean how the data and functions are layed out in a particular script, function, or class. Many of the best practices presented here are actually specific tips on design (e.g. design tips on variable usage), but this lesson focuses on the big picture design of your algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many suggestions that will be given and it is unlikely you will follow all of them every time, but if you try them out at least a few times, you'll be more likely to think about them the next time you approach a problem. As well, the tactics become easier to think through the more you do it. Soon, you can do a simple checklist in your mind before starting to code and you'll be set!"

    "\n",
    "* Use English-like statements that precisely describe specific operations. \n",
    "* Put one operation per line.\n",
    "* Avoid specific language elements. Pseudocode should be able to be implemented in any language.\n",
    "* Write at the level of intent. Describe the *meaning* of each step, not how it's implemented. (\"I don't care how it's done, just XXXXXXXXX\")\n",
    "* All the statements should be at roughly the same abstraction level. If it's not, either separate into multiple     steps or add a note that that step needs to go through the design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that it's not neccessary that each line of pseudocode must correspond to 1 line of real code. Each line of pseudocode may require a function, which is completely fine. If the goal is clear and specific, it's acceptable pseudocode.\n"
