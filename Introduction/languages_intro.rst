MATLAB Introduction
-------------------

* IDE *&* language
* New version every 6 months (YEARa, YEARb)

Pros:
* Very fast numerical operations
* "Turn-key" solution
* Built-in GUI tools, database connections, and version control (for recent versions)
* Good and full documentation

Cons:
* No choice in IDE
* Compiled programs must match MCR version *exactly*
* Narrow focus (number-crunching)
* Global namespacing
* Algorithms are proprietary
* Expensive
* Mostly functional programming

Python Introduction
-------------------

This introduction will be presented mostly as a contrast to MATLAB, since most students are familiar with it.

* Language only
* Two major versions: 2.7, 3.x

Pros:
* "Batteries included" philosophy with large standard library
* Very easy to read syntax
* High uptake in the scientific community
* General programming language
* Choice of IDE, and just about everything else
* Local namespacing
* Open-source
* Very pro-women
* Both object-oriented and functional

Cons:
* Not quite as "turn-key"; takes some set up for a full environment
* Scientific users must utilize 3rd-party packages
* Need a small amount of command-line knowledge
* Documentation can be hit or miss
