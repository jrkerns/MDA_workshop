    "* **Model real-world objects.** This is the easiest and most direct way object-oriented programming can effectively work. Real world objects have properties (data) and can do things (behavior). Because real-world objects meet both of these criteria, they are perfect models for classes/objects. Examples:\n",
    "    * ``Person``\n",
    "        * ``name``\n",
    "        * ``age``\n",
    "        * ``eat()``\n",
    "        * ``defecate()``\n",
    "    * ``Vehicle``\n",
    "        * ``model``\n",
    "        * ``mileage``\n",
    "        * ``accelerate()``\n",
    "        * ``turn()``\n",

    "        * ``perform_calculation()``\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "* **Model abstract objects.** While real-world objects are often modelled in programming, many times abstract objects are also necessary to be modelled. Although they are not \"real\" they can still easily be though of as objects.\n",
    "    * ``File``\n",
    "        * ``name``\n",
    "        * ``size``\n",
    "        * ``open()``\n",
    "        * ``close()``\n",

    "        * ``find_blobs()``\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "* **Reduce/Isolate complexity.** If you find yourself passing the same structures over and over again, it's a sign you should use a class. Furthermore, by using a class, the implementation details are hidden, reducing & isolating the complexity of the program.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    image_array = open('myimage.jpg')\n",

    "    blobs = find_blobs(thresheld_image, size=15)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  Total variables: 4; clarity: medium.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Instead of multiple functions/variables, a class has a better abstraction and is easier to read:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    image = Image('myimage.jpg')\n",
    "    image.crop(width=10)\n",
    "    image.threshold(level=0.4)\n",
    "    blobs = image.find_blobs(size=15)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  Total variables: 2; clarity: high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reuse code for similar objects.** If multiple, similar objects will be needed, it's easiest to create an initial class, and then subclass the original class and modify as needed. For example, if we need to create a system that keeps track of employees, we can create an ``Employee`` class. However, there can be both full-time and part-time employees. Instead of trying to keep track of status by passing around variables, this data can be hidden (isolating complexity) and methods can be reused or modified as necessary."
